<b>(5) Unlawful stalking</b><br><br>
No person shall unlawfully stalk another person.<br><br>
Subject to subsection (7), a person (referred to in this section as the accused person) unlawfully stalks another person (referred to for the purposes of this section as the victim) if the accused person engages in a course of conduct which —<br><br>

&emsp;(c)	the accused person —<br><br>

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;(ii)	knows or ought reasonably to know is likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress to the victim.<br><br>

&emsp;(b)	making any communication, or attempting to make any communication, by any means —<br><br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;(i)	to the victim or a related person;<br><br>

For the purposes of subsection (2)(c), the accused person ought reasonably to know that his course of conduct is likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress to the victim if a reasonable person in possession of the same information would think that the course of conduct is likely to have that effect.<br><br>
In considering whether a course of conduct is likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress, the court may have regard to the following factors:<br><br>

&emsp;(b)	the frequency and the duration of the acts or omissions associated with stalking that were carried out;<br><br>
